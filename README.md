## Curiosities about me

* I started coding when I was 13, influenced by my father, games and my brother.
* My first language stack was C# and PHP. Now it's been a while since I touched a C# code and PHP is kinda rare, just in some specifc cases I like to use it.
* I also had worked with Motion Design, 3D modelling and animation and used to have a game channel in the past that didn't gone so well :P
* Founded a marketing agency with some friends :)
